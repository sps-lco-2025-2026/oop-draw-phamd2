# OOP Draw

We will be following a tutorial on OOP that walks you through a typical app life cycle: using a framework, creating a GUI, implementing related objects, building on code you receive from someone else, and testing it. 

The tutorial is available on this repo as a PDF. 

The GUI requires the full .NET Framework for Windows, not the platform-independent .NET Core; thus, this requires the full Visual Studio Community Edition, not VS Code. So this means either:
- installing this on your machine
- or using one of the school computers. 

As is familiar by now: 

- clone this repo 
- create your solution inside that local folder 
- commit, push and sync frequently 

But, new in this assignment: 

- also answer the questions from the doc in the EAD that is on the Google Classroom assignment.
